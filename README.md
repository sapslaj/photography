# (my) photography

I take pictures sometimes, and I wanted to share them. But I'm too dumb to use a normal social media platform for this. So I built my own website.

This site is adapted from the [Next.js & Cloudinary example app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/2eda0140e3999c60006b068f9a2c2fdd010ca217/examples/with-cloudinary). It uses [Cloudflare Images](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/cloudflare-images/) for image hosting and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for the website hosting.
